<!-- Create a <main> element in your index.html file. Make sure the element has a class of container.
    Create a scripts/catalog.js module.
    Define and export a Catalog function.
    The Catalog function should accept the harvested food array as input.
    The Catalog function should iterate the array of food objects.
    As you iterate the array, the <main> element should have its inner HTML appended with an HTML 
        representation of a food item. Use the following example for each food item. The example has 
        Corn hard-coded. Yours should not. It should output the name property of the current food object. -->
